/**
 * Subagent runtime configuration.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Sets the description the root routes on and the model. The rest of the agent's surface (tools,
 * skills, nested subagents) is discovered from the filesystem. Conversation history is compacted
 * once it reaches 90% of the context window.
 *
 * This is the only specialist that treats the brand context document as its deliverable rather than
 * as input, so it carries `save_brand_context` alongside the read tool. That write overwrites the
 * document for the whole team, with no approval gate and no previous version to recover, which is
 * why the interviewing discipline in `instructions.md` matters: agreeing the document with the user
 * before saving is the only review it gets.
 *
 * A positioning document is short by design, and length here is usually a symptom of hedging rather
 * than thoroughness, so the brevity discipline lives in `instructions.md`.
