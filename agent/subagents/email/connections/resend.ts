/**
 * Bare Resend MCP tool names this agent is allowed to discover.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Resend's MCP server publishes around 85 tools, including `create-api-key`, `remove-domain`, and
 * webhook CRUD. Those are account administration rather than marketing, and an agent that can mint
 * a credential or unverify a sending domain is a much larger blast radius than the job needs, so
 * the surface is an allow list rather than a block list: a tool the server adds later is invisible
 * here until someone adds it on purpose.
 *
 * Five groups are allowed. Broadcasts and templates are the campaign itself. `get-tiptap-json-content`
 * is the editor read that `compose-broadcast` and `compose-template` require before they can set
 * content. Contacts, segments, and topics are how a campaign gets targeted. `list-emails`,
 * `get-email`, `list-logs`, and `get-log` are read-only delivery diagnostics, which is what lets the
 * agent report what actually happened instead of inferring it. `list-domains` and `get-domain` are
 * read-only and load-bearing twice over: a broadcast's `from` address has to be a verified domain,
 * and `get-domain` is the only DKIM and SPF evidence the `deliverability` skill can actually cite.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded beyond account administration: `connect-to-editor` and
 * `disconnect-from-editor` (the `compose-*` tools handle that lifecycle themselves), the inbound
 * `list-received-*` and `get-received-*` family (this agent sends, it does not triage a mailbox), and
 * `create-contact-import` and friends, because a CSV import mutates the subscriber list in bulk and
 * is better done by a person watching it. Add any of them here if you want them.

 *
 * Matching is by substring against the qualified name, so `remove-contact` also covers

/**
 * Resend connection (MCP) exposing campaign, list, and delivery tools to the model.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Authorization is user-scoped via Vercel Connect: each user signs in through their own browser
 * consent flow, the per-user token is resolved before every tool call, and it is never exposed to
 * the model. The connector only issues `user` tokens, so there is no app-scoped variant to fall
 * back on and the session needs a resolved principal before the first call.
 *
 * User scoping is worth more here than on the other connections. Sending is the one action this
 * team takes that cannot be undone, and a per-user token means Resend records who sent it rather
 * than attributing every campaign to one shared workspace credential.
 *
 * The discoverable surface is narrowed to {@link ALLOWED_TOOLS}. Calls that send mail
 * ({@link SEND_TOOLS}) or that cannot be undone ({@link DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS}) pause for an
 * approve or deny decision before they run.
