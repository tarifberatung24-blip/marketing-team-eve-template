// Subagent: SEO

/**
 * Subagent runtime configuration.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Sets the description the root routes on and the model. The rest of the agent's surface (tools,
 * skills, nested subagents) is discovered from the filesystem. Conversation history is compacted
 * once it reaches 90% of the context window.
 *
 * The description is deliberately explicit about the evidence boundary. This agent reads pages with
 * `web_fetch`, which cannot execute JavaScript or reach Search Console, so a crawl-level or
 * Core-Web-Vitals finding is outside what it can verify. Naming that in the description keeps the
 * root from routing an ask here that it can only answer by guessing, and the `seo-audit` skill
 * repeats the boundary where the model acts on it.
