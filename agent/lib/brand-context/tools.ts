 * eve resolves an agent's tools from its own `tools/` directory and subagents inherit nothing, so
 * every specialist that needs brand context calls one of these factories from a one-line file.
 * Defining them once here keeps the description, the schema, and the storage key identical across
 * agents: the document is only useful as shared ground truth if each specialist reads and writes
 * it the same way. They are factories rather than shared constants so each agent's `tools/` file
 * owns its own tool instance instead of re-exporting one.
