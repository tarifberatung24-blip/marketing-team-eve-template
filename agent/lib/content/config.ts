 * Skill layout, input bounds, and pure helpers for the shared content tooling.

 * @remarks
 * A style skill is the source of truth for how a surface writes, and this module owns the two
 * conventions that let a tool reach into one: the skill id a surface resolves to
 * ({@link styleSkillId}) and the reference file that holds its banned words
 * ({@link BANNED_WORDS_FILE}). A tool derives both from a fixed surface enum, never from free
 * model input, so renaming the convention is one edit here rather than a search across agents.
 *
 * The matching logic lives here too, because it is pure and it is where the safety properties sit:
 * {@link parseBannedWords} decides what a malformed list means and {@link findBannedWords} owns the
 * regex construction. `tools.ts` is then only the interface, and these helpers stay callable by
 * whatever content tooling lands next.
