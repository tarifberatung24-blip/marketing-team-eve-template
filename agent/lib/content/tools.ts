 * The list is read at runtime through the skill handle, so each style skill stays the source of
 * truth for its own surface. Each agent passes the surfaces it actually authors a `<surface>-style`
 * skill for, so the resolved skill id and file path come from a fixed enum and can never be
 * influenced by the caller. Any failure to resolve, read, parse, or validate the list is treated as
 * "no banned words" rather than failing the check.
 *
 * @param surfaces - Content surfaces this agent has a `<surface>-style` skill for.
