 * @remarks
 * A handoff artifact is a Markdown document one agent produces and another reads, passed by id so
 * the text never travels through the lead's context. Every specialist holds both tools; the lead
 * holds only the reader, which is what keeps a relayed document out of the conversation.
 *
 * Key layout, id format, and bounds live in `config.ts`; this module is the tool interface over it.

 * Build the tool that saves a handoff artifact.

 * Long output that another agent needs, but a human does not need to read in a chat thread, goes
 * here instead of into the handback message. The caller returns the id and a short summary, the lead
 * relays the id into the next brief, and the receiving agent reads it. The document itself never
 * passes through the lead's context.
