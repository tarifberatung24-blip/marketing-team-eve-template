  "Generic writing-quality rules for any prose meant for humans to read: keep it natural, plain, and free of AI-sounding phrasing, and check it against the AI-phrases and plain-English reference lists.

House-neutral rules for making prose read like a person wrote it, and for judging whether it does. They apply to any surface: a social post, a Notion page, a thread, release notes. Platform- or brand-specific voice guidance layers on top of them.

## When to Apply

Load this skill before:
- Drafting new content
- Editing or rewriting existing content
- Reviewing a draft

## Core Rules

1. Kill the AI tells: em-dash overuse, "delve", "leverage", "it's not just X, it's Y", rule-of-three padding, and the rest of the patterns in \`references/ai-phrases-to-avoid.md\`.
2. Prefer plain English. Swap bloated or vague wording for the shorter, concrete alternative. \`references/plain-english-alternatives.md\` is the lookup table.
3. Front-load the point. Lead sentences, paragraphs, and sections with the conclusion, because readers scan.
4. Concrete over abstract. Show an example before stating a principle, and cut hedges like "just", "simply", "very", and "really".
5. Match the user's voice, not a default. When working with existing content, keep its register and conventions. These rules trim the noise; they don't impose a personality.

## Em Dashes: The Primary AI Tell
 
The em dash (—) has become one of the most reliable markers of AI-generated content.
 
Em dashes are longer than hyphens (-) and are used for emphasis, interruptions, or parenthetical information. While they have legitimate uses in writing, AI models drastically overuse them.
 
### Why Em Dashes Signal AI Writing
- AI models were trained on edited books, academic papers, and style guides where em dashes appear frequently
- AI uses em dashes as a shortcut for sentence variety instead of commas, colons, or parentheses
- Most human writers rarely use em dashes because they don't exist as a standard keyboard key
- The overuse is so consistent that it has become the unofficial signature of ChatGPT writing
### What To Do Instead
| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| The results—which were surprising—showed... | The results, which were surprising, showed... |
| This approach—unlike traditional methods—allows... | This approach, unlike traditional methods, allows... |
| The study found—as expected—that... | The study found, as expected, that... |
| Communication skills—both written and verbal—are essential | Communication skills (both written and verbal) are essential |
 
### Guidelines
- Use commas for most parenthetical information
- Use colons to introduce explanations or lists
- Use parentheses for supplementary information
- Reserve em dashes for rare, deliberate emphasis only
- If you find yourself using more than one em dash per page, revise
