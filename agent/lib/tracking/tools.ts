/**
 * The campaign-tracking tool.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Analytics groups on exact strings, so a campaign tagged by hand across a week of posts arrives as
 * several campaigns. This is the one interface that tags a link, and it derives source and medium
 * from a fixed surface enum so they can't be spelled two ways.
 *
 * The vocabulary and the URL building live in `config.ts`; this module is the tool interface over it.
 */

/**
 * Build the tool that adds campaign parameters to links.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Batched, because a newsletter carries several links that all belong to one campaign and one
 * surface. `utm_source` and `utm_medium` come from the surface rather than from free text, which is
 * the whole reason this is a tool: hand-tagged campaigns fragment in analytics the moment two
 * people spell the source differently.
 *
 * A malformed URL fails that link alone and the rest of the batch still comes back tagged, so one
 * bad entry in a newsletter doesn't cost the other seven.
 *
 * @param surfaces - Content surfaces this agent publishes to.
 * @returns The `build_tracked_link` tool definition.
