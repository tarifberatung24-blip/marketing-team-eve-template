 * The point of routing this through a tool is consistency, not string concatenation. Analytics
 * treats `LinkedIn` and `linkedin`, or `Q3 Launch` and `q3-launch`, as different sources, so a
 * campaign tagged by hand across a week of posts arrives as several campaigns that have to be
 * reconciled later. Everything here exists to make that impossible: the source comes from a fixed
 * surface vocabulary, the medium is derived from it, and every free-text value is normalized the
 * same way.
 *
 * `utm_term` is deliberately absent. It carries the keyword on a paid search click, and nothing on
 * this team buys ads.
