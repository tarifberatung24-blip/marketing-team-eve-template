/**
 * Blob namespace layout and the reserved-path guards that protect it.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Everything the team stores lives in one Blob store, so the path layout is a shared concern
 * rather than a per-feature one. This module owns that layout: the reserved prefixes, what each is
 * for, and which tool is allowed to write it. The general-purpose asset tools consult
 * {@link reservedNamespaceForPath} and {@link reservedNamespaceForUrl} before acting, so a model
 * can't reach a managed document through a generic file operation and overwrite the team's
 * positioning or another user's preferences.
 *
 * Feature modules import their prefix from here rather than declaring their own. The dependency
 * points toward storage on purpose: adding a namespace should be a single edit in this file, and
 * the guards can only be complete if one module sees every prefix.
